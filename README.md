This repository contains the code for the course "Build a Blockchain from Scratch with Rust" by WEB3DEV with my own modifications and improvements.

Refer to the original course at [YouTube chanel of WEB3DEV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROioE9Tlrmc&list=PLVX4xVoD65UOKf2_UMyZ_Dmgm5rb7COPY).

I would like to thank the author for the course and the code for his amazing explanation and the effort he put into it.
I have learned a lot from it and I definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in blockchain technology and Rust programming.
